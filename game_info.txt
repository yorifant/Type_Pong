basically ping pong VS AI
multiple difficulties to either practice or play for beginners / advanced players
the goal is to get the highest score.
game ends when you reach 0 HP
you start with ... hp (depending on difficultly)

the game loop:
    when the ball is coming towards you, there is a word on your left and right
    by repeating the first letter of the word on your left or right, you can move left / right.
        by typing the full word before the ball arrives at you, then you hit the ball.
        -> however, once you started typing 1 word, you can't start the other one.
        -> choose direction wisely.
            if your racket isn't in the right position, you miss the ball.
            if you didn't type the full word in time, you miss the ball.
    -> you gain 1 point if you hit the ball.
        you gain 2 points if you type the last letter between a narrow time window.
    -> you lose 1 HP if you miss the ball.

different difficulties:
    practice:
        speed is slow and goes up very slow.
        window for last letter is wide.
        -> this mode exists just to practice moving, typing and timing the last letter
        you start with more HP.
        -> you can play longer per game.
    easy:
        speed starts slow, but speed goes up the longer the game goes on.
        -> starts easy, but gets harder over time. (for beginners that need to warm up first)
        window for last letter is wider.
        -> easy to get x2 points.
    hard:
        speed starts fast, and speed goes up the longer the game goes on.
        -> it starts hard and gets harder over time. (for advanced players, so that the first rounds don't become boring)
        window for last letter is smaller.
        -> difficult to get x2 points.

the actual typing:
    as previously mentioned:
        you move left / right by repeatedly typing the first letter of the word on your left / right.
        -> once you begin one word, your word choice is locked in and you can't change anymore.
            then you finish the rest of your word, and once you type the last letter of the word, you shoot with your racket.

interesting game mechanics and considerations:
    the key inputs to move around / slam your racket change every time.
    -> challenging for your brain.
    the typing speed is visualized by the ball literally coming to you faster / slower.
    -> intuitive to play.
    if you type the last letter at the very last moment within a narrow time-window, you get x2 points.
    -> higher skill ceiling, for advanced players.
